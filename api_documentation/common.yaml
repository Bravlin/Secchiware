      description: > 
        Format: SECCHIWARE-HMAC-256 keyId={keyId},[headers={headers}],signature={signature}
        Parameters:
          keyId: an opaque string identifier that helps the server find the necessary credentials to validate the signature.
          headers: an arbitrarily ordered list of the names in lowercase of the headers whose values weere used to generate the signature, separated by semicolons (';').
          signature: a base 64 encoded string of the HMAC-SHA256 digest generated with the necessary credentials following the algorithm explained next.
        Algorithm:
          1- Create an empty string.
          2- Append the method of the request in lowercase followed by a newline character ('\n').
          3- Append the canonical URI (path from host, without query string) of the request followed by a newline character ('\n').
          4- If there is a query string, append it URL-encoded (space=%20) followed by a newline character ('\n').
          5- For every header specified, append the following expression: "{header_name}: {header_value}\n",
            where header_name is the key of the header in lowercase and header_value is its corresponding value.
            For the last header the trailing newline character MUST be omitted.
          6- Calculate the HMAC-SHA256 digest of the generated string and base 64 encode it to obtain the signature.
